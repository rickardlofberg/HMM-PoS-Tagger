* Things TODO

** Build a tagger
A tagger which takes a sentence and tags it

** Function to feed the tagger
A function which parses a corpus and feeds the tagger one sentence at a time, possibly write the output to a file

** Something that evaluates the tagging
Compare the tagged corpus to our tagger, how good is it?

** Something which cleans the corpus for us
This code should clean the corpus so that we can parse it

** Something which divide the corups in 10 pars for 10-fold validation
We should train on 9 of the parts and hide the tenth part, this one we tag and evaluate.
